# Browserscript
This Browserscript was created for use on the new Peppermint release, following Peppermint 10, it should work on any Debian/Ubuntu based system. It has a menu which you can choose to download and add Firefox latest, and install Google Chrome, Brave and/or Vivaldi.
"Note For Firefox":Firefox is downloaded to /opt/firefox/firefox it also comes with a firefox-stable.desktop file which is copied to /usr/share/applications/firefox-stable.desktop (which makes it available within the menu), the script also creates a link from /opt/firefox/firefox to /usr/bin/firefox.
Please enjoy!
